What is a Service Mesh? From Linkerd docs
A service mesh is a tool for adding observability, security, and reliability features to ‚Äúcloud native‚Äù applications by transparently inserting this functionality at the platform layer rather than the application layer.
Few of the commonly used service meshes are Linkerd, Istio, Consul etc.
Why Linkerd? Significantly lighter than competitors.</description></item><item><title>Jina ‚ù§Ô∏è Serverless</title><link>http://deepankarm.github.io/posts/jina-serverless/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 17:49:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://deepankarm.github.io/posts/jina-serverless/</guid><description>What is Jina?

What is serverless? From Wikipedia
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers.
Also,
&amp;ldquo;Serverless&amp;rdquo; is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers.</description></item></channel></rss>

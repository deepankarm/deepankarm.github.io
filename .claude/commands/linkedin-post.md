Generate a LinkedIn post for the blog post at $ARGUMENTS.

Read the full blog post, then write a LinkedIn post following these rules:

**Tone & style:**
- Direct, technical, no fluff. Write like an engineer talking to other engineers.
- No "excited to announce", "thrilled to share", or any performative enthusiasm.
- No hashtags. No emojis unless one fits naturally (rare).
- No bold unicode text tricks (no 𝗯𝗼𝗹𝗱 or 𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘤 unicode). Plain text only.
- Short paragraphs. Most should be 1-2 sentences.

**Structure:**
- Open with the core problem or insight — something the reader recognizes immediately. No preamble.
- Middle: what you built/wrote about and why it matters. Include concrete details — numbers, specific tech, what breaks without it.
- End with the link. No "check it out!" or "let me know what you think" — just the URL, optionally with "Read more:" or "Wrote about it:" or similar.

**Length:** 4-8 short paragraphs. LinkedIn truncates after ~3 lines, so the first line must hook.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't summarize every section of the blog post. Pick the angle that matters most.
- Don't list every feature. Pick 2-3 that land hardest.
- Don't be promotional. State what it does, not why it's amazing.
- Don't over-explain well-known problems.
- Don't be elaborate. If a point can be made in one line, don't use three.

Generate 2 variants with different angles or hooks. Let the user pick.

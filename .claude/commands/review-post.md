Review the blog post at $ARGUMENTS for coherence, flow, and technical accuracy.

Read the full post, then provide feedback on:

1. **Narrative flow**: Does the post have a clear arc? Does each section follow logically from the previous one? Are there abrupt transitions or sections that feel disconnected?

2. **Repetition**: Are any points made twice? Does the intro promise something the body already covered, or vice versa?

3. **Code examples**: Do code examples reference types, variables, or functions that weren't introduced? Are imports or setup steps missing context? Do examples build on each other consistently?

4. **Missing context**: Does the post assume knowledge it hasn't established? Is any library, tool, or concept used before being introduced?

5. **Opening and closing**: Does the opening hook the reader with a clear problem or motivation? Does the post end with a clear takeaway, next step, or call to action — not just trail off?

6. **Tone consistency**: Is the voice consistent throughout? Any jarring shifts between casual and formal?

7. **Title and description**: Evaluate the frontmatter `title` and `description`. Is the title specific enough to stand out in a feed, or is it generic? Does it accurately reflect the post's content? Is the description a compelling one-liner that would make someone click through, or is it bland/too long/too vague? Suggest alternatives if you think they can be improved.

Keep feedback concise and actionable. Quote specific lines when pointing out issues. Don't suggest adding things that weren't part of the post's scope — focus on making what's there work better.

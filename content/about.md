Hey, I'm Deepankar - a software engineer based in Bangalore. I build backends and infrastructure for AI systems, mainly in Python and Go.

Currently at GoodNotes. Previously a founding engineer at Jina AI, [acquired by Elastic](https://ir.elastic.co/news/news-details/2025/Elastic-Completes-Acquisition-of-Jina-AI-a-Leader-in-Frontier-Models-for-Multimodal-and-Multilingual-Search/default.aspx), and built high-scale backends and data pipelines at Adobe Systems. I've wanted to write for years but words never came easy. LLMs changed that - so hopefully this will be the start of something more.

I spend time on open source:
- [jina-serve](https://github.com/jina-ai/serve) 
- [langchain-serve](https://github.com/jina-ai/langchain-serve)
- [pyleak](https://github.com/deepankarm/pyleak)
- [godantic](https://github.com/deepankarm/godantic)

Father of twin toddler boys - I'm always sleep deprived.
